I had a dream one night a few weeks back wherein I was getting a Mac, but was ashamed since I'm a Linux guy. The next day I found myself eyeballing a 27" iMac on Apple's website. A couple of days later I bought an iMac. Can't ignore a sign from the universe can you?

## the good

World of Warcraft on a 27" screen. A decade ago gaming on the Mac wasn't really an option. While WoW's the only non-console game I've played over the past few years, it's nice to see Steam ported over, too.

A native experience syncing my iPod. My Amarok1.4/gPodder setup wasn't exceptionally great at this.

A simple displayport to mini-displayport cable turns it into a 27" monitor for my ThinkPad. This was actually my fall back rationale for making the purchase. *If OS X sucks too much, it'll at least be a nice monitor and will run WoW better than my current box.*

VMWare Fusion. Running ubuntu apps through unity yields a *decent* experience for the software I can't seem to get away from. Which, right now, seems to be Gnucash which has an icon in my dock that launches fairly fast for having to boot a VM in the background.

It *just* works\*

## the bad

\* Unless you want to install MySQL which is an adventure in yak shaving that makes the worst dependency hell on Linux seem tame.

MacPorts != apt-get (what a goddamn joke)

Command/Ctrl key weirdness. command-t to open a new tab, but ctrl-tab to cycle tabs? WTF

## conclusion

Not quite sure.
