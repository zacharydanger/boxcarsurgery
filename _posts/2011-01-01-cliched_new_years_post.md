New year. New blog. Stuff I want to do this year:

**Make 1$ in the Android Market.** I've been meaning to learn Android for a while now. I'd even bought [a book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430226595?ie=UTF8&tag=boxcsurg-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1430226595) on Android devlopment, but never made it past the introductory chapters. This year I intend on publishing an app to the Market and trying to earn at least 1$.

**Write _something_ every week.** I used to keep an up to date web presence, but for the past couple of years I've let it fall by the wayside. I want to finish this year with 52 blog posts instead of the whopping two I had last year.

**Ship a working copy of Loose Leaf.** Every PHP developer has their own framework, mine is called [Loose Leaf](http://www.ladieslovelooseleaf.com/). I need to upgrade it for PHP 5.3 and get it shipping on [pearhub](http://pearhub.org).

**Lose some weight.** Probably the most cliche of all my goals. The sedentary lifestyle of a full-time programmer hasn't been good to me and I've become a bit of a fat fuck. I just got some Vibram Five Fingers and I intend on putting some heavy mileage into them.

That's all for now. More soon. Hopefully.
